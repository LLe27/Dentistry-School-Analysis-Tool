## Synopsis

This project is an analysis tool for research created by the UWO Dental School.  It analyzes and graphically reports on research using a vartiety of search and sorting criteria.

## Platform

This project is written in C++ with Qt5 libraries.  As such the project is platform independant, and can be compiled and run on Linux, Windows, Unix, etc.

The GitHub repository for this project includes a precompiled executable and all libraries necessary to run the executable.

## Installation

If you wish to build this project from source you will need a C++ compiler, make, qmake, and Qt5 libraries.  Installing these prerequisites is beyond the scope of this readme.  

If you only wish to run the program, I recommend you use the precompiled Windows executable.  To run this executable you should:

1. Visit the project Git page at https://github.com/mstahl3/Dentistry-School-Analysis-Tool
2. Click the "Clone or download" button and select "Download ZIP"
3. Once downloaded open the ZIP file and extract the "Dentistry-School-Analysis-Tool-master\CompileWindows_MinGW_32bit\exe with dll" to your hard disk (eg: to c:\myapp) 4. Execute (double click) the extracted "project.exe" file from the c:\myapp folder

## Configuration

This program does not use any external configuration files.  Simply run the executable and select the appropriate data file.

## Data Files

Upon program start you will be required to select a data file (for one of the 4 data type shown on screen).  Please note these data files are proprietary (belonging to the UWO Dentistry School) and have not been included with this GitHub project.

## Contributors

This project is the work of the Pineapple Team of UWO's CS3307 course.
