# abcd
I've created empty directories to help people start to organize their files.
I suggest you create subdirectories under src and lib to help organize
each person's work (perhaps but function, etc)

Please ignore the .gitkeep files, I needed to create those to allow git to
commit empty directories.  I will delete them later.
